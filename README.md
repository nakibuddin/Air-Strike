## Project Description:

"Air Strike" is an exciting single-player desktop game where players take control of an aircraft positioned at the bottom of the screen. Their objective is to maneuver the aircraft using the left and right arrow keys, avoiding bubbles that cross the screen from top to bottom. Armed with three bullets at a time, players can shoot in three different directions: straight vertically, at a 45-degree angle to the left, and at a 45-degree angle to the right. <br>

The game features two levels: easy and hard. In the easy level, players need only one bullet to destroy a bubble, while in the hard level, two bullets are required. As the game progresses, the speed of the bubbles gradually increases, adding a dynamic challenge that tests players' reflexes and strategic thinking.  <br>


The game includes a timing feature, players can see how long they were able to survive in "Air Strike." It adds an extra layer of challenge and allows players to compete with themselves or others for the longest survival time. <br>

In "Air Strike," the speed of the bubbles increases gradually over time. This adds a dynamic and challenging element to the gameplay, requiring the player to adapt and react quickly as the game progresses. <br>

"Air Strike" also incorporates a high scorer list, where players can enter their names if they achieve a high score. Additionally, at the end of each game, the player's total score, along with their survival time, is displayed, allowing for competition and improvement. <br>

With engaging gameplay, strategic shooting mechanics, different levels of difficulty, and the thrill of achieving high scores, "Air Strike" offers an enjoyable and challenging gaming experience for players of all skill levels. <br>
